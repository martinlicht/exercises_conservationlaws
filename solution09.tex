\Head{9}{High-Order Schemes and MUSCL Reconstruction (Solution)}

See figures generated by the Matlab code.

The MUSCL scheme with zero slope leads to the most dissipative solutions. This is not surprising, since the scheme reduces to the usual first-order method implemented in previous exercises. The second-order schemes with limited linear reconstruction clearly leads to improved results. The scheme with the minmod limiter can lead to truncation near smooth extreme (as can be observed with the first initial condition). This accuracy at such points are improved by using the MUSCL limiter. Overall, the MUSCL limiter gives the best results for all initial conditions considered in this exercise.
